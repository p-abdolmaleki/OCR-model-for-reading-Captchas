# OCR model for reading Captchas
- In this repository, a model has been implemented to detect captcha.
- This implementation is based on [this example](https://keras.io/examples/vision/captcha_ocr/) on the keras site.
- Its loss function has been changed and softmax and sparse categorical cross entropy have been used to make the model more accurate.
